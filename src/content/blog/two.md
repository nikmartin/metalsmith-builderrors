Sometimes you may set a time or date in a field that you need to clear. It's simple once you know how :) To Clear a Date or Date/Time field, just LONG CLICK on the clock button. This will clear the field. The super short video below shows how.

Let us know if there's something else we can show how to do that may not be obvious. We try to make NitroPCR as easy to use as possible, but sometimes a quick tip turns into an A-HA! moment.
