While the states' adoption of NEMSIS 3 has been slow, there seems to be a consensus that '2015 is the year we all switch to NEMSIS version 3'. We are in the process of implementing NitroPCR version 1.0 which will be NEMSIS 3.3.4 compliant. It is going faster than we though it would and we hope to be certified by April. The NEMSIS 3 Schema is much more user friendly, using more 'plain english' names for data elements and removing a lot of antiquated data standards (I'm looking at you FIPS). Stay tuned I'll post progress as we make it. Right now we're about 5% complete and have only been working full time on it for a week.
